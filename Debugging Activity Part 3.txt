Debugging Explanation for Activity Part 3 

Main issue:

1. Didn't know exactly where to put the places array at first. 
2. Placed the array in the index.js file at first (Thought the array would show up on the index.js if directly placed in this particular file. 
3. Asked Johnathon Hinchley for help on Slack for debugging.
4. Didn't understand at first, but Mr.Hinchley sent a client-server model diagram he created.
5. Using the model, I realized that the place.js file in the Controllers folder is the server where the index.js file would be displayed. 
6.Therefore, I have to type the places array into places.js which would sent the information to the index.js (this is the file that would be easily accessed by the user at first) 
7.Understood main purpose of app.use('/places', require('./controllers/places'))
a. index.js would use the 'places' file and display it
8. By coding the array in the 'places.js' file, the information in the array would also appear in the localhost:3000/places as well.
9. Places.js file embeds the array HTML into the index.js using 'JSX' 
a. Places.js 'JSX' code: 
	router.get('/', (req, res) => {
    res.render('places/index', {places})
			})
